            I'm a self-taught Full Stack Developer with a passion for building scalable,
             high-performance web applications. Iâ€™ve developed 5+ websites as a freelancer and specialize in React, 
             Next.js, and the MERN Stack. I previously worked at Deloitte and led projects that streamlined workflows. Outside of work,
             I enjoy optimizing web performance and exploring new technologies

            <p className="mt-3 md:text-lg tracking-wide leading-7 text-[var(--secondary)]">I was born in Karur, Tamil Nadu, in a small village where most people couldn't even afford to study. But me? I had big dreams of becoming a businessmanâ€”just like my parents. There was just one small problemâ€¦ I had zero business ideas.
College was a wild ride. While I was supposed to be studying, I was usually bunking classes to play volleyball. But of course, I had to come up with a smart excuseâ€”so I told my professor I was developing a websiteâ€¦ except I had absolutely no clue how websites worked.
Then one day, out of nowhere, I got a call from a guy saying my professor had referred me to build a website. Waitâ€¦ what? Thatâ€™s when panic mode activated, and I had no choice but to actually learn web development for real.
Fast forward a few monthsâ€”I started loving coding. Now, Iâ€™m on a journey to master Full-Stack Development, where I truly believe my future lies (hopefully, with fewer volleyball distractions). ðŸ˜†ðŸ”¥</p>
